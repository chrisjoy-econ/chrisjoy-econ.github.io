                I'm Christopher -- a consultant and researcher interested in developing economies with a particular focus on Southeast Asia's rapid growth
                and economic rise. I consider my work interdisciplinary, pulling from such diverse areas as female empowerment, poverty
                reduction to the region's political economies and state-society relations. I also, on occaision, focus on international macroeconomics.
                I have spent significant portions of the last decade in Southeast Asia and speak Vietamese, Indonesian and Thai.

              <h4>Working Life</h4>
              <p>
              I worked as a software and support developer in the private sector, for a at the time <a class="link-opacity-75-hover" href="https://www.novachem.com">Fortune 500 company</a>, 
              where I developed and maintained software for the chemical industry. I also provided technical support to clients,
              trained users, and built documentation repositories. I then moved in roles at smaller and mid-sized companies, eventually starting my own company with a former colleague. After selling the company, 
              I spent the next few years consulting for small and mid-sized businesses in the US and Southeast Asia prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
              Following the sale of my company, I returned to graduate school to pursue my interests in economics and Southeast Asia.
              </p>
              <h4>Education</h4>
              <p>
              I hold an MSc in Development Economics and an MA in Southeast Asian Studies from 
              <a class="link-opacity-75-hover" href="http://www.city.ac.uk">City, University of London</a> and 
              <a class="link-opacity-75-hover" href="https://www.soas.ac.uk/">SOAS, Universty of of London</a> respectively. I did my undergraduate

                    <dd>Against the backdrop of the world&apos;s “missing women”, Southeast Asia offers an example of both developed 
                        and developing countries that do not see unnatural sex-birth imbalance and raises the question, 
                        what is the state of female empowerment and economic development in  Southeast Asia/ASEAN.
